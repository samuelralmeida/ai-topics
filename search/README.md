# AI Topics - Search

This project is part of the AI Topics series.

It implements uninformed searches algorithms using stack or queue data structure to solve mazes.

## Run the application:

bash

    go run main.go


Usage

    -m: Specify the maze filename (default is maze1.txt).
    -f: Choose the frontier option (stack or queue, default is queue).
    -s: Display the solution path in the image (default is true).
    -e: Display the explored path in the image (default is false).


## Results

The program will output the solution path and generate an image of the maze with the solution path highlighted.

The image will be saved as filename-frontier.png in the current directory.
