# AI Topics - Adversarial Search

This project is part of the AI Topics series.

It implements minimax algorithms to play tic-tac-toe game.

Minimax is an adversarial search algorithm, meaning it attempts to find the best decision to optimize a scoring objective. In this implementation, the best achievable outcome is a tie, the artificial intelligence never loses.

This code is inspired by [CS50's IA](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/)

## Run the application:

bash

    go run main.go
